algothon1.py is my final choice . Others are my other codes which I rejected considering the time complexity
My code solves the problem of finding the shortest delivery times from a central warehouse (node 1) to multiple delivery points in a city grid, where the city is represented as a directed graph. Each intersection is a node, and each road is a directed edge with a traffic delay (weight). The Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to compute the shortest paths from the warehouse to all other intersections. The graph is constructed using an adjacency list, where for each road (represented as a tuple [u, v, w]), u is the start intersection, v is the destination intersection, and w is the road's traffic delay. The algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently process nodes in increasing order of their known shortest distance, updating the shortest paths to neighbors as it goes. After running Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest delivery times to the specified delivery points (given as a list) are simply extracted from the resulting distance array. This ensures that the shortest times from the warehouse to all other nodes are computed first, and then the relevant delivery times are quickly obtained. The approach is efficient, handles large graphs well, and provides the correct shortest delivery times to multiple points based on the initial computation from the warehouse.

If the panel requires me to explain why I selected this approach in more detail,I have done the detailed written approximation and will explain it during the viva
